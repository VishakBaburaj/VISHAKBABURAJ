### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Data Analyst with a passion for solving complex business problems, I have leveraged my technical skills and experience to help businesses make informed decisions that drive growth and profitability. With a dual Master's degree in Decision Analytics and Business Analytics, I possess a strong foundation in data management, data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and data visualization, and I have experience working with SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python.

In my most recent role at Ourdate, I had the opportunity to work on a range of projects that required me to apply my technical skills and collaborate with cross-functional teams. I used keyword extraction techniques to identify top market barriers and recommended a new product feature to the CEO, resulting in improved market penetration. I also worked with a team of UX designers to create prototyped usability testing for the product, which led to a 76% customer satisfaction rate. Additionally, I uncovered top engineering issues impacting initial year success by collecting and analyzing competitor reviews using a topic modeling approach, which enabled the engineering team to make the necessary enhancements.

Prior to my work at Ourdate, I was a Data Analyst at Tenhard India, where I used web scraping and sentiment analysis to identify the highest-rated books and prioritize best sellers, resulting in a monthly revenue boost of INR 10K+.

My project experience includes a study of the landscape of data analyst roles in the United States, where I conducted quantitative analyses of 100+ US data analysts to uncover insights into career transition difficulty, overall work-life balance, and career advancement.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess a range of soft skills that have enabled me to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams and effectively communicate complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders. I am highly detail-oriented and possess strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which have allowed me to uncover valuable insights and make data-driven recommendations.

I am also a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate holder and am committed to ongoing learning and professional development in the field of data analytics. If you are looking for a data analyst with a passion for solving complex business problems and a proven track record of delivering results, please do not hesitate to reach out.
